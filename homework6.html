<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h3>In this assignment, I downloaded tabular data from census.data.gov estimating the total population enrolled in college or graduate school in the state of Colorado. The data is distributed by county in a chloropleth map. I cleaned the csv data tables and joined tabular data to shapefile data in QGIS. As the legend shows, darker shades of orange in the county indicate a higher population enrolled in college/graduate school.</h3>
